# RobotFramework

## Introduction
***Hey All ! How is it going ? This is Abhishek and I cam up with an exciting and most trending automation practice widely used these days***
#### Let's get started 
**Robot Framework** is a generic test automation framework for acceptance testing and acceptance test-driven development (ATDD). It has easy-to-use tabular test data syntax and it utilizes the keyword-driven testing approach.

Its testing capabilities can be extended by test libraries implemented either with Python or Java, and users can create new higher-level keywords from existing ones using the same syntax that is used for creating test cases.

I've created this **RPA project** which is quite simple and easy to understand.So let's discuss more about it...
